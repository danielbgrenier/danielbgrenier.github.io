            <a href="/pdfs/Searle-Indirect_speech_acts_(1975).pdf" target="_blank">Indirect Speech Acts - John R. Searle</a>
            <br><br>
            This chapter from Searle's book <i>Expression and Meaning</i> focuses on when a speech act has some indirect
            intent. Similar to implicature, these are departures from the literal meaning of the sentence. Searle focuses
            specifically on cases where teh speaker intends exactly what he say <i>and something more</i>. The first example
            given is the statement "I want you to do it" which is both true in that the speaker wants the hearer to do
            something, but also a request that the hearer does that (a statement and a request). Antoher example given is
            "Can you reach the salt?" (a question and a request). The hypothesis Searle defends in this paper is:
            <p style="margin-left: 25px;">
                "In indirect speech acts the speaker communicates
                to the hearer more than he actually says by way of relying
                on their mutually shared background information, both
                linguistic and nonlinguistic, together with the general
                powers of rationality and inference on the part of the hearer."
            </p>
            As an in depth example, Searle gives the short exchange of
            <p style="margin-left: 25px;">
                <i>X: Let's go to the movies tonight.</i><br>
                <i>Y: I have to study for an exam.</i>
            </p>
            Where X's statement is clearly a proposal and Y's statment is a rejection of that proposal, although indirectly.
            This is obvious enough to language users, but Searle manages to distinguish <b>10</b> (!) different steps that are
            taken to determine that Y's response is a rejection (and even mentions that this is maybe not sufficient). Those
            ten steps are:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <i>I have made a proposal to Yy and in response he has made a
                    statement to the effect that he has to study for an exam (facts about the
                    conversation).</i>
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <i>I assume that Y is cooperating in the conversation and that
                    therefore his remark is intended to be relevant (principles of
                    conversational cooperation).</i>
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <i>A relevant response must be one of acceptance, rejection,
                    counterproposal, further discussion, etc. (theory of speech acts).</i>
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <i>But his literal utterance was not one of these, and so was not
                    a relevant response (inference from Steps 1 and 3).</i>
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <i>Therefore, he probably means more than he says. Assuming
                    that his remark is relevant, his primary illocutionary point must
                    differ from his literal one (inference from Steps 2 and 4).</i>
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <i>I know that studying for an exam normally takes a large
                    amount of time relative to a single evening, and I know that going to the
                    movies normally takes a large amount of time relative to a single
                    evening (factual background information).</i>
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <i>Therefore, he probably cannot both go to the movies and study
                    for an exam in one evening (inference from Step 6).</i>
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <i>A preparatory condition on the acceptance of a proposal, or on
                    any other commissive, is the ability to perform the act predicated in the
                    propositional content condition (theory of speech acts).</i>
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <i>Therefore, I know that he has said something that has the
                    consequence that he probably cannot consistently accept the proposal
                    (inference from Steps 1, 7, and 8).</i>
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <i>Therefore, his primary illocutionary point is probably to
                    reject the proposal (inference from Steps 5 and 9).</i>
                </li>
            </ol>
            In the end the conclusion is still probabilistic because a qualifying statement from Y, such as "but
            let's go anyway," would cause the response to be an acceptance. The most important step here to Searle
            is step 5 because this is the point at which hearers determine if there is an indirect meaning at all.
            <br><br>
            Searle now departs to list general forms of indirect requests, which he lumps into categories (S meaning
            speaker, H meaning hearer, and A meaning action):
            <ol>
                <li> Sentences concerning H's ability to perform A:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Can you</b> reach the salt?</li>
                        <li><b>You could</b> be a little more quiet.</li>
                        <li><b>Are you able</b> to reach the book on the top shelf?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li> Sentences concerning S's wish or want that H will do A:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>I would like you</b> to go now.</li>
                        <li><b>I'd rather you didn't</b> do that anymore.</li>
                        <li><b>I hope you'll</b> do it.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li> Sentences concerning H's doing A:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Will you</b> quit making that awful racket?</li>
                        <li><b>Would you</b> kindly get off my foot?</li>
                        <li><b>Aren't you</b> going to go?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li> Sentences concerning H's desire or willingness to do A:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Would you be willing</b> to write a letter of recommendation for me?</li>
                        <li><b>Do you want</b> to hand me that paper over there?</li>
                        <li><b>Would you mind</b> being a little quiter?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li> Sentences concerning reasons for doing A:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>You should</b> leave now.</li>
                        <li><b>Why not</b> stop here?</li>
                        <li><b>It would be a good idea if</b> you left town.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li> Sentences embedding one of these elements within another:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Would you mind awfully if I asked you if you could</b> write me a letter of recommendation?</li>
                        <li><b>Might I ask you</b> to take off your hat?</li>
                        <li><b>I would appreciate it if you could</b> make less noise.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            Searle now lists a series of general facts about indirect speech acts, at least one of which all other theories
            about them disagree with. He goes into more detail about the implications of each facts which can be read about
            in his paper (p.13-17).
            <ol>
                <li>The sentences in question do not have an imperative force as part of their meaning.</li><br>
                <li>The sentences in question are not ambiguous as between an imperative illocutionary
                force and a nonimperative illocutionary force.</li><br>
                <li>Notwithstanding Facts 1 and 2, these are standardly, ordinarily, normally - indeed,
                I shall argue, conventionally - used to issue directives.</li><br>
                <li>The sentences in question are not, in the ordinary sense, idioms.</li><br>
                <li>To say they are not idioms is not to say they are not idiomatic.</li><br>
                <li>The sentences in question have literal utterances in which they are not also indirect requests.</li><br>
                <li>In cases where these sentences are uttered as requestsy they still have their literal meaning
                and are uttered with and as having that literal meaning.</li><br>
                <li>It is a consequence of Fact 7 that when one of these sentences is uttered with the primary
                illocutionary point of a directive, the literal illocutionary act is also performed.</li>
            </ol>
            The most interesting fact here to me is fact 6, which means that for any of these a situation can be devised, however
            convoluted it may be, in which the statement is NOT an indirect request. After a brief analysis of the different
            groups defined earlier, Searle makes a series of very important generalizations.
            <ol>
                <li>S can make an indirect request (or other directive) by either asking whether or stating that a preparatory
                condition concerning H's ability to do A obtains.</li><br>
                <li>S can make an indirect directive by either asking whether or stating that the propositional content
                condition obtains.</li><br>
                <li>S can make an indirect directive by stating that the sincerity condition obtains,
                but not by asking whether it obtains.</li><br>
                <li>S can make an indirect directive by either stating that or asking whether there are good
                or overriding reasons for doing A, except where the reason is that H wants or wishes, etc.,
                to do A, in which case he can only ask whether H wants, wishes, etc., to do A.</li>
            </ol>
            The first of these states a question regarding whether it is <i>possible</i> for H to fulfill the request,
            the second is a question about whether H is <i>willing</i> to fulfill the request, the third is about
            whether S <i>desires</i> the request to be fulfilled, and the fourth is about whether there are reasons
            the request <i>should or should not</i> be fulfilled. Searle goes on the do another rigorous detailing of
            10 steps as earlier, this time so that the hearer understands that an indirect request is being made. It
            is fairly redundant, so if interested it is on pages 20-21 of the PDF. What is important is the two
            requirements for an indirect request to be an indirect request, namely that the hearer needs a strategy
            for finding out if there is a second (indirect) illocutionary point and then a strategy for finding out
            what that is. The first, Searle says, is taken from the principles of conversation and the second from
            the theory of speech acts and general background information. He also notes that the primary reason for
            making indirect requests is politeness.
            <br><br>
            Now Searle addresses some problems with this theory, the first being that some sentences which fit his
            framework of an indirect request are less clear as requests than others. For example, "Can you hand me
            that book on the top shelf?" is clearly a request, but "Is it the case that you at present have the
            ability to hand be that book on the top shelf?" is less so. The answer he provides to this, in short,
            is that the first conforms to conventions (while the second does not) and is idiomatic (which the second
            is not). He goes as far as to suggest an addition to Grice's conversational maxims, namely the maxim 
            "Speak idiomatically unless there is some special reason not to," which would eliminate this issue entirely.
            <br><br>
            The second problem is about why the sincerity condition (whether S or H wants A to happen), can only
            be expressed in one direction. That is, S can ask whether H wants to do A, but not whether S wants H
            to do A. Similarly, S can state that they want to do A, but not that H wants to do A. This is simply
            explained in that when speaking we do not have knowledge of others psychological states, but we do have
            knowledge of our own, a fact which is understood by both parties.
            <br><br>
            The final problem is about the specific forms of some of the indirect requests such as the "why not
            plus verb" form. It is possible for the verb to be something voluntary, like stopping as in "Why not
            stop here?" but not something involuntary, like "Why not resemble your grandmother?" These are very
            minor issues and according to Searle only really change the general categories into which the forms
            would fall.
            <br><br>
            Until now, Searle has been exclusively talking about indirect requests, but to close the chapter he
            extends this theory to other illocutionary acts. Any arbitrary illocutionary act can be performed by
            asserting the satisfaction of the sincerity condition, for which he provides the examples
            <ul>
                <li>I am sorry I did it (an apology).</li>
                <li>I think/believe he is in the next room (an assertion).</li>
                <li>I am so glad you won (congratulations).</li>
                <li>I intend to try harder next time, coach (a promise).</li>
                <li>I am grateful for your help (thanks).</li>
            </ul>
            Searle takes the time to take an in depth look at the illocutionary act of commisives (promises), from which
            he returns another set of generalizations.
            <ol start="5">
                <li>S can make an indirect commissive by either asking whether or stating that the preparatory condition
                concerning his ability to do A obtains.</li><br>
                <li>S can make an indirect commissive by asking whether, though not by stating that, the preparatory condition
                concerning H's wish or want that S do A obtains.</li><br>
                <li>S can make an indirect commissive by stating that, and in some forms by asking whether, the propositional
                content condition obtains.</li><br>
                <li>S can make an indirect commissive by stating that, but not by asking whether, the sincerity condition obtains.</li><br>
                <li>S can make an indirect commissive by stating that or by asking whether there are good or overriding reasons
                for doing A, except where the reason is that S wants or desires to do A, in which case he can only state but not
                ask whether he wants to do A.</li>
            </ol>
            The full analysis can be found on pages 28-30, but what is important is that this sort of generalization can be
            made for any illocutionary act. Namely, it seems as though for any act, asking about or asserting the necessary
            conditions (in the proper context) can be meant as an indirect performance of that act.

            Yes, I am taking a Roman Empire class (I know). The majority of courses here in Pécs don't have much homework,
            for this course there are (I believe) four total assignments: one final 5-10 page paper (25%), two 30 question multiple
            choice quizzes (25% each), and one quiz on the memorization of this map (25%):

            The memorization quiz is first (two weeks into the semester), so to prepare, I created <a href="https://www.sporcle.com/games/Yepindicus/roman-empire-provinces-and-cities-1" target="_blank">this Sporcle quiz</a>
