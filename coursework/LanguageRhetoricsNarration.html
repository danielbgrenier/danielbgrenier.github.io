            <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4166848" target="_blank">A Classification of Illocutionary Acts - John R. Searle</a>
            <br><br>
            This paper from 1976 attempts to create a rigorous classification system for illocutionary acts.
            <br><br>
            <b>Some Important Terms:</b>
            <div id="terms" style="margin-left: 25px;">
                <b>S</b> - Abbreviation meaning Speaker.
                <br>
                <b>H</b> - Abbreviation meaning Hearer.
                <br>
                <b>A</b> - Abbreviation meaning Act.
                <br>
                <b>p</b> - Abbreviation for an arbitrary preposition.
                <br>
                <b>Locutionary Act</b> - Any use of language, all "utterances" are locutionary acts.
                <br>
                <b>Illocutionary Intent</b> - This is the intended impact that the speaker has when making an illocutionary act.
                Intended impacts could be to get the listener to do something, to make a promise, describe the speaker's mental
                state, etc. Every illocutionary intenet must be paired with a locutionary act, but not every locutionary act has
                an illocutionary intent.
                <br>
                <b>Perlocutionary Effect</b> - What happens because of a locutionary act. Not all perlocutionary effects are intended 
                and therefore are not illocutionary acts. Similarly not all illocutionary intents have a perlocutionary effect.
                However, both must be the result of locutionary acts, neither can occur without one.
            </div>
            <p style="font-size: small; margin-left: 25px;">NOTE: There are nuances between "acts, forces, and points" in all three
            categories. These nuances are somewhat beyond me, however Searle does distinguish between them in the paper.</p>
            <br>
            There are defined by Searle, "(at least) twelve significant dimensions of variation in which illocutionary acts
            differ from one another." The three most important are the
            <ol>
                <li>Difference in the point of the act</li>
                <li>Differences in the direction of fit between words and the world</li>
                <li>Differences in expressed psychological state</li>
            </ol>
            The first rule specifies what the intention of the speaker is, similar to the illocutionary effect. A speaker may
            attempt to represent the world as in a statement of facts, commit themself to something as in a promise, or try
            to get the listener to do something as in a request or command. Searle does not provide an exhaustive list of different
            points (although the classes listed later give a fairly good idea).
            <br><br>
            The second rule specifies whether the speaker is trying to fit their words to the world, as in a statement of fact
            wherein the speaker is trying to morph their words so they accurately represent the world, or trying to fit the world
            to their words, as in a promise wherein the speaker commits to morph the world to match their words.
            <br><br>
            The third rule expresses the psychological state of the speaker (sometimes called the "sincerity condition" in the paper),
            examples being belief of something being the case (B), a desire or want for something (W/D),
            or an intention to do something (I). Pleasure is also listed with examples
            like congratulating and welcoming, but Searle again does not procide these as an exhaustive list.
            <br><br>
            The remaining rules are interesting and can be read about in the full paper. However, they are less
            important to Searle and simply tweak the specifics of the general categories defined
            by the first three rules. These categories are:
            <br><br>
            <b>Representatives</b> commit the speaker to something being the case. The point of the act is to communicate something
            the speaker believes, the direction of fit is words to world, and the psychological state is belief (B), specifically
            belief that p. Every statement that is a representative can be evaluated as either true or false.
            <br><br>
            <b>Directives.</b> The point of a directive is to get the speaker to do something, the direction of fit is
            world to words, and the psychological state is desire (D), specifically that H does A. Directives can have
            varying degrees of intensity; invitations, requests, and orders are all directives.
            <br><br>
            <b>Commissives</b> commit the speaker to a certain course of action. The point of the act is to commit the
            speaker to do something, the direction of fit is world to words, and the psychological state is intention (I),
            specifically that S does A. Promises and threats both fall under this category.
            <br><br>
            <b>Expressives.</b> The point of an expressive is the accurately represent the psychological state of the
            speaker with regards to a certain event. Expressives are notable in that they do not have a direction of fit
            and the psychological state is variable (fitting to whatever is expressed). Some examples provided by Searle are:
            <ul>
                <li>"I apologize for stepping on your toe."</li>
                <li>"I thank you for paying me the money.</li>
                <li>"I congratulate you for winning the race."</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Declarations</b> are illocutionary acts which "brings into existense the state of affairs to which is refers."
            Examples given that might help to understand better are:
            <ul>
                <li>"I declare war."</li>
                <li>"I resign."</li>
                <li>"I excommunicate you."</li>
            </ul>
            The point is to declare something as the case and cause it to happen, the direction of fit is notable in that it is both fitting words to
            world and world to words at the same time, and there is no psychological state.
            <br><br><br>
            Searle continues to analyze linguistically the structure of each of these categories. It is quite technical and
            I recommend reading his work if interested. In conclusion Searle states:
            <p style="margin-left: 25px">"The most important conclusion to be drawn from this discussion is this.
                There are not, as Wittgenstein (on one possible interpretation) and many others
                have claimed, an infinite or indefinite number of language games or uses of
                language. Rather, the illusion of limitless uses of language is engendered by an
                enormous unclarity about what constitutes the criteria for delimiting one language
                game or use of language from another. If we adopt illocutionary point as
                the basic notion on which to classify uses of language, then there are a rather
                limited number of basic things we do with language: <b>we tell people how things
                are, we try to get them to do things, we commit ourselves to doing things, we
                express our feelings and attitudes and we bring about changes through our
                utterances.</b> Often, we do more than one of these at once in the same utterance."</p>

            <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2183301" target="_blank">Intention and Convention in Speech Acts - P. F. Strawson</a>
            <br><br>
            This paper is from 1964 and focuses on the intention of speech acts, specifically with illocutionary acts. It is predominantly
            a response to two other works:
            <ol>
                <li><a href="pdfs/Austin-How_to_do_things_with_words_(1962).pdf" target="_blank">How To Do Things With Words - J. L. Austin</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2182440" target="_blank">Meaning - H. P. Grice</a></li>
            </ol>
            The first is a series of lectures delivered by J. L. Austin at Oxford and Harvard, compiled into a book in 1962 which
            is a very influential work on the philosophy of language. Austin developed the theory of speech acts and this
            book is essentially a summary of all his work until this point. Most works on the philosophy of language written
            after the release of this book reference it heavily.
            <br><br>
            Grice's paper, written in 1957 classifies the difference between meaning in a natural sense and meaning in a non natural sense as well as
            delves deeper into the meaning in a non natural sense and exactly what the intentions of the speaker must be. "Meaning"
            as Grice describes in the natural sense, is when some x factually entails some y. Examples include:
            <ul>
                <li>Those spots meant measles</li>
                <li>Thunder means lightning</li>
                <li>The recent budget means that we shall have a hard year</li>
            </ul>
            In all these examples, it is not possible to have x (those spots, thunder, the recent budget) without having y 
            (measles, lightning, a hard year). There are ways in which these statements can be false or misleading; the spots are 
            painted on, a recording of thunder was played, the budget was miscalculated, however for purposes of communication
            we care only about the if x then y nature of the sentences.
            <br><br>
            This can be contrasted with "meaning" in the non-natural sense (meaning<sub>NN</sub>), which gets significantly
            more complicated. As Grice describes it, three conditions must be met for a speaker S to mean<sub>NN</sub> something:
            <ol>
                <li>A speaker S must intend (i1) by uttering x to produce a certain response y in an audience A</li>
                <li>S must intend (i2) that A shall recognize this intention (i1)</li>
                <li>S must intend (i3) that the recognition of their intention (i1) functions as (part of) A's reason for a response y</li>
            </ol>
            Deciphering this set of conditions is done best by Strawson in his paper, which then goes on to add a fourth condition:
            <ol start="4">
                <li>S must intend (i4) that A shall recognize their intention (i2)</li>
            </ol>
            This extra condition is added as a result of a counter example provided in his paper (p.447), and suggests,
            as Strawson admits, that this sort of intention recognition may be allowed to go on indefinitely, with increasingly
            convoluted scenarios being drawn up where this intention is not enough to qualify an act that "should" count
            as meaning something as meaning something according to the conditions. To counteract this, it is noted that just a
            "mutual understanding" suffices.

            <a href="/pdfs/Grice_Logic_&_Conversation_(1989).pdf" target="_blank">Studies in the Ways of Words - Paul Grice</a>
            <br><br>
            This paper is also from a series of lectures collected into a book, this time from Paul Grice. The primary focus
            of this paper is on <b>implicature</b> - when what is said is not what is meant - and what Grice calls the <b>Cooperative
            Principle</b>. The purpose of the paper according to Grice is to highlight the differences between natural language
            and an "ideal language," like the formal logic of logicians.
            In particular, there are two main ways that logicians/linguists view these differences:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Formalists - Those who believe that the formal logic statements are superior because they have a definite
                    truth value, so any statements made within it's framework can be evaluated as true or false if given a 
                    set of initial accepted true statements. The deviations between natural language and this are imperfections
                    of natural language, an ideal language should be contructed which has no such ambiguities.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Informalists - Those who believe that language is not constructed with the sole purpose to convey truth.
                    There exist statements within natural language which can be understood, yet logical analysis of them is
                    impossible. The logic of natural language and the formal logic of logicians are not one in the same and
                    operate with different rules and goals.
                </li>
            </ul>
            However, what Grice believes is that the deviations which inspire these two schools of thought do not
            actually exist within natural language, but are rather a misunderstanding of "conditions governing conversation."
            <br><br>
            <b>Implicature</b>, as stated early, is simply when the literal meaning of the words stated is not what is
            meant by the statement. There are two types of implicature according to Grice: conventional and conversational.
            Conventional implicatures are related to semantics, where the meaning behind the implication is not grounded in the
            context of the conversation. An example from the internet is "Donovan is poor but happy", where the word "but" is
            implying a contrast between being poor and being happy. Conversational implicature on the other hand,
            requires an understanding of the conversation so far.
            <br><br>
            Here Grice briefly departs and defines what he calls the <b>Cooperative Principle</b>:
            <p style="margin-left: 25px;">"Make your conversational contribution such as is required, at the stage at which
            it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged."</p>
            This, Grice proposes, is a sort of general rule which people follow when conversing and Grice 
            lays out some specific categories under this principle and maxims within each for effective communiation.
            These categories roughly follow Kant's categories of thought and have become fairly well known.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Quantity
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Make your contribution as informative as is required (for the current purposes of the exchange)</li>
                        <li>Do not make your contribution more informative than is required</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Quality - Try to you make your contribution one that is true (what Grice calls the "supermaxim")
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Do not say what you believe to be false</li>
                        <li>Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Relation - Be relevant</li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Manner - Be perspicuous (ironically does not follow his own rule, perspicuous means "lucid" or "clear")
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Avoid obscurity of expression</li>
                        <li>Avoid ambiguity</li>
                        <li>Be brief (avoid unnecessary prolixity)</li>
                        <li>Be orderly</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
            Grice notes that this list is both incomplete and that some of these matter much more in conversation than others
            (someone using too many words is more forgivable than someone lying). He also notes that these maxims are followed
            in nonverbal exchanges as well, providing examples for each (p.9). Grice proposes that these maxims are usually followed
            by people, so any departure must be done with some object in mind (presupposing that the Cooperative Principle is
            still being followed). Grice gives four types of non-adherence:
            <ol>
                <li>A person can <b>violate</b> a maxim by quietly failing to follow it</li>
                <li>A person can <b>opt out</b> of a maxim by making it clear they will not be</li>
                <li>A person can be faced with a <b>clash</b> of maxims, where it is impossible to follow both</li>
                <li>A person can <b>flout</b> a maxim, also called an <b>exploitation</b> - the most important of the four</li>
            </ol>
            The connection between the Cooperative Principle with it's maxims and implicature is now made clear and Grice defines
            what specifically is required for a statement to be an implicature. When a speaker in saying <i>p</i> is implying
            <i>q</i>, the following must be satisfied:
            <ol>
                <li>They are presumed to be following the conversational maxims, or at least the Cooperative Principle</li>
                <li>They must think that <i>q</i> is required to make their saying <i>p</i> consistent with the Cooperative Principle</li>
                <li>They must believe the hearer capable of picking up on their belief that <i>q</i> is required</li>
            </ol>
            Grice goes on to provide a whole bunch of examples of how each type of non-adherence can be used in implicature (p.12-18)
            but the majority of every day implicatures come from flouting principles (some do not go against any maxims at all).
            These conversational implicatures are what Grice calls "particular," which just means that they need context.
            To close his paper, Grice lists some features shared by all conversational implicatures:
            <ol>
                <li><b>Cancelable</b> - the sentence can be added to so as to remove the implication.</li>
                <li><b>Nondetachable</b> - no way of saying the exact same sentence without the implicature, i.e.,

            <a href="/pdfs/Searle-Indirect_speech_acts_(1975).pdf" target="_blank">Indirect Speech Acts - John R. Searle</a>
            <br><br>
            This chapter from Searle's book <i>Expression and Meaning</i> focuses on when a speech act has some indirect
            intent. Similar to implicature, these are departures from the literal meaning of the sentence. Searle focuses
            specifically on cases where teh speaker intends exactly what he say <i>and something more</i>. The first example
            given is the statement "I want you to do it" which is both true in that the speaker wants the hearer to do
            something, but also a request that the hearer does that (a statement and a request). Antoher example given is
            "Can you reach the salt?" (a question and a request). The hypothesis Searle defends in this paper is:
            <p style="margin-left: 25px;">
                "In indirect speech acts the speaker communicates
                to the hearer more than he actually says by way of relying
                on their mutually shared background information, both
                linguistic and nonlinguistic, together with the general
                powers of rationality and inference on the part of the hearer."
            </p>
            As an in depth example, Searle gives the short exchange of
            <p style="margin-left: 25px;">
                <i>X: Let's go to the movies tonight.</i><br>
                <i>Y: I have to study for an exam.</i>
            </p>
            Where X's statement is clearly a proposal and Y's statment is a rejection of that proposal, although indirectly.
            This is obvious enough to language users, but Searle manages to distinguish <b>10</b> (!) different steps that are
            taken to determine that Y's response is a rejection (and even mentions that this is maybe not sufficient). Those
            ten steps are:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <i>I have made a proposal to Yy and in response he has made a
                    statement to the effect that he has to study for an exam (facts about the
                    conversation).</i>
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <i>I assume that Y is cooperating in the conversation and that
                    therefore his remark is intended to be relevant (principles of
                    conversational cooperation).</i>
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <i>A relevant response must be one of acceptance, rejection,
                    counterproposal, further discussion, etc. (theory of speech acts).</i>
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <i>But his literal utterance was not one of these, and so was not
                    a relevant response (inference from Steps 1 and 3).</i>
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <i>Therefore, he probably means more than he says. Assuming
                    that his remark is relevant, his primary illocutionary point must
                    differ from his literal one (inference from Steps 2 and 4).</i>
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <i>I know that studying for an exam normally takes a large
                    amount of time relative to a single evening, and I know that going to the
                    movies normally takes a large amount of time relative to a single
                    evening (factual background information).</i>
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <i>Therefore, he probably cannot both go to the movies and study
                    for an exam in one evening (inference from Step 6).</i>
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <i>A preparatory condition on the acceptance of a proposal, or on
                    any other commissive, is the ability to perform the act predicated in the
                    propositional content condition (theory of speech acts).</i>
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <i>Therefore, I know that he has said something that has the
                    consequence that he probably cannot consistently accept the proposal
                    (inference from Steps 1, 7, and 8).</i>
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <i>Therefore, his primary illocutionary point is probably to
                    reject the proposal (inference from Steps 5 and 9).</i>
                </li>
            </ol>
            In the end the conclusion is still probabilistic because a qualifying statement from Y, such as "but
            let's go anyway," would cause the response to be an acceptance. The most important step here to Searle
            is step 5 because this is the point at which hearers determine if there is an indirect meaning at all.
            <br><br>
            Searle now departs to list general forms of indirect requests, which he lumps into categories (S meaning
            speaker, H meaning hearer, and A meaning action):
            <ol>
                <li> Sentences concerning H's ability to perform A:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Can you</b> reach the salt?</li>
                        <li><b>You could</b> be a little more quiet.</li>
                        <li><b>Are you able</b> to reach the book on the top shelf?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li> Sentences concerning S's wish or want that H will do A:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>I would like you</b> to go now.</li>
                        <li><b>I'd rather you didn't</b> do that anymore.</li>
                        <li><b>I hope you'll</b> do it.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li> Sentences concerning H's doing A:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Will you</b> quit making that awful racket?</li>
                        <li><b>Would you</b> kindly get off my foot?</li>
                        <li><b>Aren't you</b> going to go?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li> Sentences concerning H's desire or willingness to do A:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Would you be willing</b> to write a letter of recommendation for me?</li>
                        <li><b>Do you want</b> to hand me that paper over there?</li>
                        <li><b>Would you mind</b> being a little quiter?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li> Sentences concerning reasons for doing A:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>You should</b> leave now.</li>
                        <li><b>Why not</b> stop here?</li>
                        <li><b>It would be a good idea if</b> you left town.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li> Sentences embedding one of these elements within another:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Would you mind awfully if I asked you if you could</b> write me a letter of recommendation?</li>
                        <li><b>Might I ask you</b> to take off your hat?</li>
                        <li><b>I would appreciate it if you could</b> make less noise.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            Searle now lists a series of general facts about indirect speech acts, at least one of which all other theories
            about them disagree with. He goes into more detail about the implications of each facts which can be read about
            in his paper (p.13-17).
            <ol>
                <li>The sentences in question do not have an imperative force as part of their meaning.</li><br>
                <li>The sentences in question are not ambiguous as between an imperative illocutionary
                force and a nonimperative illocutionary force.</li><br>
                <li>Notwithstanding Facts 1 and 2, these are standardly, ordinarily, normally - indeed,
                I shall argue, conventionally - used to issue directives.</li><br>
                <li>The sentences in question are not, in the ordinary sense, idioms.</li><br>
                <li>To say they are not idioms is not to say they are not idiomatic.</li><br>
                <li>The sentences in question have literal utterances in which they are not also indirect requests.</li><br>
                <li>In cases where these sentences are uttered as requestsy they still have their literal meaning
                and are uttered with and as having that literal meaning.</li><br>
                <li>It is a consequence of Fact 7 that when one of these sentences is uttered with the primary
                illocutionary point of a directive, the literal illocutionary act is also performed.</li>
            </ol>
            The most interesting fact here to me is fact 6, which means that for any of these a situation can be devised, however
            convoluted it may be, in which the statement is NOT an indirect request. After a brief analysis of the different
            groups defined earlier, Searle makes a series of very important generalizations.
            <ol>
                <li>S can make an indirect request (or other directive) by either asking whether or stating that a preparatory
                condition concerning H's ability to do A obtains.</li><br>
                <li>S can make an indirect directive by either asking whether or stating that the propositional content
                condition obtains.</li><br>
                <li>S can make an indirect directive by stating that the sincerity condition obtains,
                but not by asking whether it obtains.</li><br>
                <li>S can make an indirect directive by either stating that or asking whether there are good
                or overriding reasons for doing A, except where the reason is that H wants or wishes, etc.,
                to do A, in which case he can only ask whether H wants, wishes, etc., to do A.</li>
            </ol>
            The first of these states a question regarding whether it is <i>possible</i> for H to fulfill the request,
            the second is a question about whether H is <i>willing</i> to fulfill the request, the third is about
            whether S <i>desires</i> the request to be fulfilled, and the fourth is about whether there are reasons
            the request <i>should or should not</i> be fulfilled. Searle goes on the do another rigorous detailing of
            10 steps as earlier, this time so that the hearer understands that an indirect request is being made. It
            is fairly redundant, so if interested it is on pages 20-21 of the PDF. What is important is the two
            requirements for an indirect request to be an indirect request, namely that the hearer needs a strategy
            for finding out if there is a second (indirect) illocutionary point and then a strategy for finding out
            what that is. The first, Searle says, is taken from the principles of conversation and the second from
            the theory of speech acts and general background information. He also notes that the primary reason for
            making indirect requests is politeness.
            <br><br>
            Now Searle addresses some problems with this theory, the first being that some sentences which fit his
            framework of an indirect request are less clear as requests than others. For example, "Can you hand me
            that book on the top shelf?" is clearly a request, but "Is it the case that you at present have the
            ability to hand be that book on the top shelf?" is less so. The answer he provides to this, in short,
            is that the first conforms to conventions (while the second does not) and is idiomatic (which the second
            is not). He goes as far as to suggest an addition to Grice's conversational maxims, namely the maxim 
            "Speak idiomatically unless there is some special reason not to," which would eliminate this issue entirely.
            <br><br>
            The second problem is about why the sincerity condition (whether S or H wants A to happen), can only
            be expressed in one direction. That is, S can ask whether H wants to do A, but not whether S wants H
            to do A. Similarly, S can state that they want to do A, but not that H wants to do A. This is simply
            explained in that when speaking we do not have knowledge of others psychological states, but we do have
            knowledge of our own, a fact which is understood by both parties.
            <br><br>
            The final problem is about the specific forms of some of the indirect requests such as the "why not
            plus verb" form. It is possible for the verb to be something voluntary, like stopping as in "Why not
            stop here?" but not something involuntary, like "Why not resemble your grandmother?" These are very
            minor issues and according to Searle only really change the general categories into which the forms
            would fall.
            <br><br>
            Until now, Searle has been exclusively talking about indirect requests, but to close the chapter he
            extends this theory to other illocutionary acts. Any arbitrary illocutionary act can be performed by
            asserting the satisfaction of the sincerity condition, for which he provides the examples
            <ul>
                <li>I am sorry I did it (an apology).</li>
                <li>I think/believe he is in the next room (an assertion).</li>
                <li>I am so glad you won (congratulations).</li>
                <li>I intend to try harder next time, coach (a promise).</li>
                <li>I am grateful for your help (thanks).</li>
            </ul>
            Searle takes the time to take an in depth look at the illocutionary act of commisives (promises), from which
            he returns another set of generalizations.
            <ol start="5">
                <li>S can make an indirect commissive by either asking whether or stating that the preparatory condition
                concerning his ability to do A obtains.</li><br>
                <li>S can make an indirect commissive by asking whether, though not by stating that, the preparatory condition
                concerning H's wish or want that S do A obtains.</li><br>
                <li>S can make an indirect commissive by stating that, and in some forms by asking whether, the propositional
                content condition obtains.</li><br>
                <li>S can make an indirect commissive by stating that, but not by asking whether, the sincerity condition obtains.</li><br>
                <li>S can make an indirect commissive by stating that or by asking whether there are good or overriding reasons
                for doing A, except where the reason is that S wants or desires to do A, in which case he can only state but not
                ask whether he wants to do A.</li>
            </ol>
            The full analysis can be found on pages 28-30, but what is important is that this sort of generalization can be
            made for any illocutionary act. Namely, it seems as though for any act, asking about or asserting the necessary
            conditions (in the proper context) can be meant as an indirect performance of that act.
