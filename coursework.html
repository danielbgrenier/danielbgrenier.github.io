            <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4166848" target="_blank">A Classification of Illocutionary Acts - John R. Searle</a>
            <br><br>
            This paper from 1976 attempts to create a rigorous classification system for illocutionary acts.
            <br><br>
            <b>Some Important Terms:</b>
            <div id="terms" style="margin-left: 25px;">
                <b>S</b> - Abbreviation meaning Speaker.
                <br>
                <b>H</b> - Abbreviation meaning Hearer.
                <br>
                <b>A</b> - Abbreviation meaning Act.
                <br>
                <b>p</b> - Abbreviation for an arbitrary preposition.
                <b>Locutionary Act</b> - Any use of language, all "utterances" are locutionary acts.
                <br>
                <b>Illocutionary Intent</b> - This is the intended impact that the speaker has when making an illocutionary act.
                Intended impacts could be to get the listener to do something, to make a promise, describe the speaker's mental
                state, etc. Every illocutionary intenet must be paired with a locutionary act, but not every locutionary act has
                an illocutionary intent.
                <br>
                <b>Perlocutionary Effect</b> - What happens because of a locutionary act. Not all perlocutionary effects are intended 
                and therefore are not illocutionary acts. Similarly not all illocutionary intents have a perlocutionary effect.
                However, both must be the result of locutionary acts, neither can occur without one.
            </div>
            <p style="font-size: small; margin-left: 25px;">NOTE: There are nuances between "acts, forces, and points" in all three
            categories. These nuances are somewhat beyond me, however Searle does distinguish between them in the paper.</p>
            <br>
            There are defined by Searle, "(at least) twelve significant dimensions of variation in which illocutionary acts
            differ from one another." The three most important are the
            <ol>
                <li>Difference in the point of the act</li>
                <li>Differences in the direction of fit between words and the world</li>
                <li>Differences in expressed psychological state</li>
            </ol>
            The first rule specifies what the intention of the speaker is, similar to the illocutionary effect. A speaker may
            attempt to represent the world as in a statement of facts, commit themself to something as in a promise, or try
            to get the listener to do something as in a request or command. Searle does not provide an exhaustive list of different
            points (although the classes listed later give a fairly good idea).
            <br><br>
            The second rule specifies whether the speaker is trying to fit their words to the world, as in a statement of fact
            wherein the speaker is trying to morph their words so they accurately represent the world, or trying to fit the world
            to their words, as in a promise wherein the speaker commits to morph the world to match their words.
            <br><br>
            The third rule expresses the psychological state of the speaker (sometimes called the "sincerity condition" in the paper),
            examples being belief of something being the case (B), a desire or want for something (W/D),
            or an intention to do something (I). Pleasure is also listed with examples
            like congratulating and welcoming, but Searle again does not procide these as an exhaustive list.
            <br><br>
            The remaining rules are interesting and can be read about in the full paper. However, they are less
            important to Searle and simply tweak the specifics of the general categories defined
            by the first three rules. These categories are:
            <br><br>
            <b>Representatives</b> commit the speaker to something being the case. The point of the act is to communicate something
            the speaker believes, the direction of fit is words to world, and the psychological state is belief (B), specifically
            belief that p. Every statement that is a representative can be evaluated as either true or false.
            <br><br>
            <b>Directives.</b> The point of a directive is to get the speaker to do something, the direction of fit is
            world to words, and the psychological state is desire (D), specifically that H does A. Directives can have
            varying degrees of intensity; invitations, requests, and orders are all directives.
            <br><br>
            <b>Commissives</b> commit the speaker to a certain course of action. The point of the act is to commit the
            speaker to do something, the direction of fit is world to words, and the psychological state is intention (I),
            specifically that S does A. Promises and threats both fall under this category.
            <br><br>
            <b>Expressives.</b> The point of an expressive is the accurately represent the psychological state of the
            speaker with regards to a certain event. Expressives are notable in that they do not have a direction of fit
            and the psychological state is variable (fitting to whatever is expressed). Some examples provided by Searle are:
            <ul>
                <li>"I apologize for stepping on your toe."</li>
                <li>"I thank you for paying me the money.</li>
                <li>"I congratulate you for winning the race."</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Declarations</b> are illocutionary acts which "brings into existense the state of affairs to which is refers."
            Examples given that might help to understand better are:
            <ul>
                <li>"I declare war."</li>
                <li>"I resign."</li>
                <li>"I excommunicate you."</li>
            </ul>
            The point is the declare something as the case, the direction of fit is notable in that it is both fitting words to
            world and world to words at the same time, and there is no psychological state.
            <br><br><br>
            Searle continues to analyze linguistically the structure of each of these categories. It is quite technical and
            I recommend reading his work if interested. In conclusion Searle states:
            <p style="margin-left: 25px">"The most important conclusion to be drawn from this discussion is this.
                There are not, as Wittgenstein (on one possible interpretation) and many others
                have claimed, an infinite or indefinite number of language games or uses of
                language. Rather, the illusion of limitless uses of language is engendered by an
                enormous unclarity about what constitutes the criteria for delimiting one language
                game or use of language from another. If we adopt illocutionary point as
                the basic notion on which to classify uses of language, then there are a rather
                limited number of basic things we do with language: <b>we tell people how things
                are, we try to get them to do things, we commit ourselves to doing things, we
                express our feelings and attitudes and we bring about changes through our
                utterances.</b>Often, we do more than one of these at once in the same utterance."</p>

        <p>
            Yes, I am taking a Roman Empire class (I know). The majority of courses here in Pécs don't have much homework,
            for this course there are (I believe) four total assignments: one final 5-10 page paper (25%), two 30 question multiple
            choice quizzes (25% each), and one quiz on the memorization of this map (25%):
            <br><br>
            <img src="images/Roman Empire Map - Labeled (Resized).jpg" id="REMap">
            <br>
            The memorization quiz is first (two weeks into the semester), so to prepare, I created <a href="https://www.sporcle.com/games/Yepindicus/roman-empire-provinces-and-cities-1" target="_blank">this Sporcle quiz</a>
            which is a bit easier to test myself with than the physical paper.
