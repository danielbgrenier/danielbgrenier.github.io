        <h3>Permutations of n objects among n people</h3>
        <p>A poor title for something I found</p>
        <hr color="black" size="1px">
        <p>
            This is an interesting problem I discovered and have been trying to work through with only my own knowledge and
            methods. It likely already exists under a more accurate and technical name somewhere in combinatorics or graph theory,
            but for now this is all my own work.
            I was playing a game which involved each player writing on a piece of paper, then passing it to somebody else.
            There were n players, so n pieces of paper, and each player was to receive each paper exactly once, so a total
            of n-1 rounds. Furthermore, each player should receive a piece of paper from each other player, and in turn give
            a piece of paper to each other player, again exactly once by necessity. For what number(s) of players is it possible
            to fulfill all these conditions and how many different ways can the papers be passed?
            <br><br>
            We will start with a numbering of the rules to reference later:
            <ol>
                <li>Each player must receive each paper exactly once</li>
                <li>Each player must receive a paper from each other player exactly once</li>
                <li>Each player must pass a paper to each other player exactly once (corollary of 2)</li>
            </ol>
            Beginning with the simplest case, n=2, it is clear that there is exactly one solution (in fact only one candidate at all),
            which is for both players to swap pieces of paper. For n=3, it appears at first to be impossible (which I will show later
            is correct), as after all three players rotate papers, the only way for each player to receive a paper they have not
            seen yet is by rotating the same direction again, violating rule 2. To understand why this is, we will consider rule 3.
            If we imagine the players standing in a circle, with 3 people player A must pass once to the left and once to the right
            to fulfill rule 3. However this will result in any paper

        <h3>The Collatz Conjecture</h3>
        <hr color="black" size="1px">
        <p>
            Like any self respecting math major, I've tried my hand at solving the Collatz conjecture (to no avail [yet]).
            These are the different methods I've looked into and how far I got into all of them, but first some defintions.
            <br><br>
            First, the function I will be using is
            <p>\[H^x(n) = \begin{cases}
                n/2 & n \equiv 0\mod{2}\\
                3n+1 & n \equiv 1\mod{2}
                \end{cases}\]</p>
            Where n is a natural number and x is the x-th iteration of the function (H is for Hailstone). So,
            \[H^3(5) = H^2(3\cdot 5 + 1) = H^2(16) = H^1\left(\frac{16}{2}\right) = H^1(8) = H^0\left(\frac{8}{2}\right) = H^0(4) = 4\]
            Or, more simply,
            \[H^3(5) = 4\]
            <br><br>
            Second, we should define what exactly the conjecture is. What Collatz proposed was that for any natural number
            \(n\), repeated iterations of the function would eventually result in that number reaching 1 (more specifically the 4-2-1 cycle).
            To use the notation layed out earlier:
            \[\forall n \in \mathbb{N}: \lim_{x\to\infty} H^x(n) = 1\]
            <p style="font-size: small;">NOTE: This is an abuse of notation because the limit of any n as x approaches infinity
            does not exist (or is infinite), as with our notation there is no stop to the 4-2-1 cycle.</p>
            The path each number takes when iterated is called its hailstone sequence, or just sequence.
            For example, the hailstone sequence of 3 is:
            \[3 \to 10 \to 5 \to 16 \to 8 \to 4 \to 2 \to 1 \to 4 \to 2 \to 1 \to ...\]
            Note that for every natural number anyone has ever tried, the sequence generated ends in the 4-2-1 cycle. For our purposes,
            we will cut the hailstone sequence of each number once it reaches 1.
            Now we can begin on the actual math part. The first question to ask is how to prove (or disprove) the conjecture.
            Proving the conjecture can be done two ways: forwards or backwards.
            To prove the Collatz Conjecture in the forwards direction, we would need to show that any number in the
            series eventually becomes 1. This is simple to state, but extremely difficult to prove, especially with
            arbitrary numbers. This can be made slightly easier by loosening this constraint, requiring numbers only
            smaller at some point in their cycle. That is,
            \[\forall n \in \mathbb{N}-\{1\} \exists x \mid H^x(n) \lt n\]
            Since the Hailstone function only operates on the natural numbers, \(H^x(n)\) is a natural number for every
            x and n. Therefore, if we can prove this for each and every n, then each chain
