            <br><br>
            These three singles are all from Novo Amor's upcoming album, "Collapse List" (currently mentioned on my home page).
            Each of them are wonderful, Land Where I Land is my personal favorite. He also has a 2020 album entitled
            "Cannot Be, Whatsover" which has a number of great songs as well. I like "I Feel Better," "Halloween," and "Guestbook"
            a lot, but every song on there is great. 
            <br><br>
            UPDATE: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lyMxK-bBpRQo7jY_E33iMWpMgKVuTz1dA" target="_blank">Collapse List</a>
            has released and it is pretty good. My personal highlights are probably "First Place," "Co-Pathetic," and "Just Another Way."

            Both of these come from Steven Suptic, the first is also currently mentioned on my home page. The "Oh, Death (EP)"
            contains some of my favorite songs ever, most notably the song "Oh, Death" which absolutely everyone should listen to.

            <br><br>
            These are both works of fiction by sports writer Jon Bois, focusing on football in the far future. I
            promise it is much more interesting than it sounds. When 20020 came out in 2020, a third installment titled
            20021 was announced for release the next year. The prospects of it actually coming out are dwindling.
            Open on desktop for best results (at least for 17776).

            <br><br>
            Based on the short story of the same name by Jorge Luis Borges, this is a (nearly complete) digital version
            of the library decribed in Borges short story. The library is supposed to contain every book of "every possible
            combination of 410 pages of letters, thus containing every book that ever has been and every book that
            ever could be written. Nearly complete because although the site has every possible page, multiple times at that,
            it does not contain every possible book. The website is well worth a look and likely warrants a longer analysis
            from me at some point in the future.

            <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11280740/" target="_blank">Severance</a>
            <br><br>
            Severance was created by Dan Erickson, stars Adam Scott, was produced by Apple TV+,
            and several episodes of season one were directed by Ben Stiller. I'm not particularly 
            a fan of any of these people individually or Apple TV+, but the show (or at least season 1)
            is phenomenal. Some of the writing captures the culture of the late 2010s and early 2020s
            extremely well, which unfortunately also means those parts may age rather quickly.
